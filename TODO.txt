TODO :
- improvements to be done in ImageSparseSolver.source_surface_brightness() method
- consistent source grid coordinates wrt image plane, when origin of coordinates is not center of the image
- put coordinates grid in kwargs_source, so source_surface_brightness is not dependent on the solver (only on numerics and kwargs_source)
- introduce x, y grid / interpolation in starlets function()
- supersampling of image plane


NOTES
- does the random initialization affect the result (should not in the convex setting of S, but how knows?)


is it correct that neither grad_loss or loss applies the likelihood_mask ??
